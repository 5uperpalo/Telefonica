\section{Introduction}

We consider QoE and socio-economic relation in a large European mobile operator along three dimension: space, user (seems covered by incas. missing time connected to a technology) and time.

The metric we consider are:
\begin{itemize}
\item amount of traffic per technology, \ie 3G and 4G maybe more.  As for space we see richer LSOE have more traffic in 3G and less in 4G than poorer LSOE (Google data. Need to be done with our).  Time connected to a technology. 
\item Signal strength (RSRP in 4G).
We found weaker signal in 4G for richer LSOE (from google data). This explain the above point. 
\item Quality.RSRQ for google data. 
We  found that RSRP/RSRQ is lower for richer classes, which mean better quality despite lower signal. This can be explained via density.
n our data we can look at VDT and CSI. 
\item Density, \ie number of connected devices and connection time. We see less devices connected in richer LSOE.
\item Video consumption and quality as special category of traffic. For google we observed poorer classes what more youtube.
\end{itemize}
